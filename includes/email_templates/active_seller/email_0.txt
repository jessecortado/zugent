Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

Thank you for selecting us to represent you in the sale of your property. I know that weâ€™ll work well together and I look forward to getting your property sold.

Your property is currently live on our MLS and we are in the process of syndicating it to hundreds of different websites.

As you know, I will be focused on finding buyers and marketing your property.

I block out my morning schedule each day to make sure these marketing activities get done. I am committed to having open lines of communication with my clients, so if you ever call and I do not answer immediately, be assured, I will call you back.

Again, I look forward to helping you get this sold, so please feel free to call or email me any time.

Your Realtor,
