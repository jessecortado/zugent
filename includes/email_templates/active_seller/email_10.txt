Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Obviously, you know that your property is already in the MLS and being exposed to thousands of potential buyers. We have kicked off our full-court press on the marketing efforts that we’re going to use to get the right buyer to include your property in their list of possible purchases.

There are a few common questions listed below that we get from other agents who are considering properties like yours for their clients. Could you take a quick look through these and let me know how you feel about each so I can be prepared for any questions that other agents may have.

1. Are you willing to do any owner financing for potential buyers? If you are, do you have specific terms that you would request?
2. Is there anything right now that would require you to have a longer-than-normal closing period?
3. Do you have any records of past maintenance on any of your appliances or the major systems of your property?

Let me know if there is any additional information that needs to go front-and-center in your file. It’s my goal to have everyone on the same page with information regarding the sale of your property.

Your Realtor,
