Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I was hoping we would have your property sold by now. I think it may be a good time to put our heads together and discuss what we can change to make your property more appealing to the buyers in our market.

There have been a good many properties showing up on the ‘MLS Expired’ list recently. I want to make sure we do everything we can to get this sold. I am working on a plan to make another marketing push and wanted to talk about another pricing strategy that may attract more attention.

Don’t forget to use the Estimated Seller Net Proceeds Calculator to see the impact a different price could have on your property.

Please let me know when we can talk.

Your Realtor,
