Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

My guess is that neither of us anticipated that selling your property would take this long. My intention was to have this sold by now.

I have used a bonus strategy on a few of my listings in the past and the results were very positive.

I am wondering if you would agree to offer an additional $1000 bonus to the buyerâ€™s agent? This bonus is not for me to earn more. Every dollar of it will go to any agent that brings a buyer at an acceptable price to you.

If you agree, I will promote this throughout the MLS as a way to attract more showings on your property.

Keep in mind, the bonus is only paid if the offer they present is acceptable to you. If the offer is low, then you can reject it and the bonus would not apply.

The market has become very competitive and this is one way that we can refresh your listing and get a lot more attention.

Would you approve of me offering an additional $1000 bonus to any agent who brings an acceptable offer that results in a closed transaction?

Let me know so I can start promoting this incentive.

Your Realtor,
