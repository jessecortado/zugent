Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I wanted to check with you to see if you actually have a Facebook Profile? Not everyone has one, but if you do, it may be a good idea to post a link to your listing page on your wall.

I would be more than happy to do this.

Do you have a Facebook Page?

Please let me know.

If so, I will go to your Facebook profile and post the details of your property for sale. This is just one more way we can get additional exposure for your property.

Your Realtor,
