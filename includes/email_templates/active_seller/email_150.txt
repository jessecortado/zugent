Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I have been getting a lot of questions about the internet and if we have our listings on Zillow, Trulia and other Non-MLS systems. I want you to know that we do promote our properties on these services for the marketing of our listings.

In addition to these websites, we have your property listed on over 100 different sites on the web.

Forgive me if this is information you are not concerned about, but I have had sellers asking me about this lately.

Have a great day,

Your Realtor,
