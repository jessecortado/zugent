You have had this listing for approximately 5 months and it could be about to expire.

The 5th month is another place where a lot of owners start looking for another agent. You can get more extensions by staying in contact with your seller. An extension is just like a new listing.

It is recommended that you call the seller immediately and ask for an extension.

Let the seller know you are committed to getting this sold and you will continue to be creative with ways to generate more demand for their property.

Getting a 6-month extension is like taking a new listing.
