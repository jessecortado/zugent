Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

As usual, I want to keep in communication with you about your listing. Even though it has been on the market longer than we anticipated, I am still making your property a priority of mine.

It may be a good time to refresh the descriptions of your property on the MLS. I have done this before and was wondering if you would give me some help.

No one knows your property better than you, so if you wanted to write a description and send it to me, I would be happy to put it on the MLS as well as the internet. I am not trying to get out of doing my job, I just thought it would be good to get your perspective on the property.

If you do not want to write the full description, then email me some thoughts on what is special about your property. I can take what you give me and write the remarks myself.

I appreciate you working with me on this. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Your Realtor,
