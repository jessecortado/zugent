Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I have noticed a trend in our marketplace recently where other agents are not giving feedback on showings as much as they did in the past.

We attempt to get as much feedback as possible, but, when we aren’t able to get any specific feedback, it's usually due to one of the following reasons:

1. Agents are showing their buyers a lot of property. When we contact them asking for feedback on yours specifically, they often don’t remember which one we are asking about. Rather than give inaccurate feedback, they choose not to respond to our emails or return our voicemails. 

2. The buyer’s agent REPRESENTS the buyer. They have a fiduciary duty to avoid doing things that could hurt the buyers negotiating position if they put an offer on a property. They don’t want to show their cards. 

3. The agents saw enough value in the property from the marketing package that was presented to them, but the buyer themselves didn’t see enough value in the property to warrant a serious consideration for an offer.

When there are showings and no offers, even though there may not be written “feedback”, the reality is that the buyer is giving feedback simply by not moving forward with an offer. When you are getting a lot of showings and no offers, sometimes a small price adjustment can make the difference in getting an offer sooner rather than later.

I thought you may find it helpful to understand more about the marketing process. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Your Realtor,
