Another 30 days has gone by and the property is unsold. This unsold listing is money held hostage. Meaning, if you get this sold, you get paid.

How about asking for a price reduction? What is the worst thing that can happen, they say NO?

If they say NO, then you are no worse off. If they say YES, you may get paid.

Give them a call so they know you have not forgot about them.
