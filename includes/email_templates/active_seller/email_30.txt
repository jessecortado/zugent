Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope you were able to take a minute and read the email I sent you a few days ago about the buyer feedback process. I am sure feedback about your property is important to you, and I want you to know that feedback about your selling experience is important to me.

Of course I love to hear from my clients after their property has sold about how great their experience was, BUT, I also want to know how you think things are going so far.

Please take just a minute or two to complete a quick progress update for me so I know whatâ€™s on your mind and how we can create the best experience for you during the sale.

Your Realtor,
