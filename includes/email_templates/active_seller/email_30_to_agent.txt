You have had this listing for 30 days. If you have not called them then you may want to today. Keep in touch with your sellers.

Ask for a reduction if you feel it will help attract an offer faster.

In most cases, a small adjustment in price will increase the number of showings you get on a listing which gives you a better chance of getting an offer.

More Showings = More Offers = More Sales = More Happy Clients
