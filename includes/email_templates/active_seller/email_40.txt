Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope things are going well for you. I wanted to reach out to let you know that we are working on getting your property sold.

I just want to bring you up to date on some of the things we’re doing to market it.

Your property remains listed in the local MLS website. This is the single most important point of exposure because virtually every real estate sales person in town gets MLS information regularly. The public also has access to the MLS website.
We subscribe to a PAID syndication service for your property listing. Think of this as having a “spider web” effect on the exposure of your property. The listing is literally posted on hundreds of additional websites.
We have notified every salesperson in our company about your property. As a group, we are an active bunch. There isn’t a better group of active real estate professionals to be found anywhere in this area.
We recently sent a notification directly to all of the active agents in the MLS to promote your property and spark activity.
The above are just a few things that I am doing to attract buyers to your property. I will continue to implement additional marketing ideas until we get the property sold. If you have any questions, please feel free to call or email us.

Your Realtor,
