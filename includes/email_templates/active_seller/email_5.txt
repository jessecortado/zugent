Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope all is well with you. I know you’re looking forward to seeing how the market responds to your property being available.

I don’t want to bombard you with a bunch of emails, but there are some things that are very important to share with you when it comes to the selling process. Instead of interrupting your day with a call or a voicemail, I wanted to send this information over to you so you can review on your time.

Please take a look at the 30 Day Milestones that we are striving for on your listing.

These milestones are the benchmarks that we know are important in order to position your property to sell in a timely manner for the best price possible.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.

Your Realtor,
