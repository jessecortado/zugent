Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I want to check in with you to let you know we are going to freshen up the “Agent Comments” in your listing this week. We have been on the market for about 70 days now and I am looking for different ways to give your listing a different look.

I really want to get this sold, so I will be going through our buyer databases in hopes to generate additional leads for your property.

I also wanted to check in with you to see if there are any changes that you would like me to make to the listing. Sometimes sellers will add a bonus to the buyer’s agent and other times they just make a slight price adjustment in order to attract a new pool of buyers that were not previously looking at the property due to the current price.

I created a calculator for my clients to calculate how different price points impact their bottom line.

You can enter different list prices and auto-calculate what the net would be. A lot of my sellers use this to make informed decisions.

Let me know if you would like to discuss your property, our marketing efforts or anything else that is on your mind.

I will continue to keep you updated.

Your Realtor,
