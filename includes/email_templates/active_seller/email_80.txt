~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to let you know that I am keeping my eyes on your property and we are contacting every buyer lead that inquires. We get a lot of traffic on our websites and we are following up with these leads and sending out info on your property as much as possible.

There is not a lot to report today, but I still want to stay in communication with you often.

Please let me know if there is anything that you would like to discuss. I am always available to talk about the status of your property.

Your Realtor,
