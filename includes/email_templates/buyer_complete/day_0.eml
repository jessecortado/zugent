Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Congratulations again on your new purchase. I think that you have timed the market well and should be happy with this investment.

I wanted to make sure you have our contact information in case something comes up that we can do for you. Remember, we still have contact with the seller, so if you ever have a question that only the past seller can answer, we can get the answer for you.

Feel free to contact us anytime.

Your Realtor,
