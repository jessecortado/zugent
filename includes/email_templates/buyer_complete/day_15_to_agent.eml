~Owner.FirstName~,

It has been approximately 2 weeks since you closed this transaction with the Adopt a Buyer Client named ~Contact.FirstName~~Contact.LastName~.

It is recommended that you give them a call and see how things are going.

Let the, know that you have a lot of information on their new property and that you are there for them anytime they need something. I bet their last agent isnâ€™t keeping up with them anymore. This is your chance to make them your client for life.

I am sure they are telling all of their friends about their new purchase which makes it a great time to get referrals from them.
