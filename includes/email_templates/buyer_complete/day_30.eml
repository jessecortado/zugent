Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I need to make sure that you received a copy of the Closing Documents from your attorney? It is critical that you have this for tax purposes. We have kept a copy on file, so let us know if you would like us to scan and email you a copy.

Also, we hope you find value in the real estate updates we send monthly. By the way, we have a few more good investments. Do you know anyone is looking to make a purchase?

Let us know if you need anything else.

Your Realtor,
