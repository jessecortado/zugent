Dear %client_fullname%,

Buying a new property can be a stressful experience. I want this experience to be special for you and will do what I can to ease the burden of shopping for your home. 

Before I say anything else I would like to thank you for your trust in me as a realtor.

Some people think that starting the process of finding a home without a realtor is fine and will visit new construction lots to browse the model homes or go to only open houses. This is not true. While these methods get you in the door to look around in some houses a majority of the market requires a realtor to let you in the door and show you the home.

I also go the extra mile by networking with my peers to find out about homes that will be coming on the market before they are even listed. In a hot market this head start in your search can mean everything!

Feel free to browse the listings on my page. If you see anything you like don't hesitate to let me know.

I look forward to our next conversation,
