Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I really appreciate you allowing me to share new listings that come on the market. The market is very active so it is important that we stay on top of the new listings as well as those that have recent price adjustments.

I understand your needs may change from time to time, so please let me know if I need to change your search criteria. This will effect the types of properties I send for your review.

I understand it may be early in the buying process but I think you will find this article about bank financing helpful.
