Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

One thing you know for sure; you know I am good at keeping you updated as to what is happening in our local market. I have been sending you new listing alerts over the past few months and it appears that you are still waiting for that perfect property. I am glad that you are not rushing into a purchase, because that is exactly how people find themselves in a bad position.

I want to make sure that we are looking at the right properties, so please update me with what you are looking for...

Unfortunately, a lot of real estate agents want to set you up on a quick property drip. I believe the real estate purchase is an important step to building wealth and it is one that we must take seriously. Please click the link above and give me some additional information. Taking 30 seconds to do this could save you thousands in purchase price and years of disappointment.

I look forward to working with you.

Your Realtor,
