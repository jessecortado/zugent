Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I am sure you are keeping up with the market. I have noticed the competition for some of the better deals is starting to increase. It isn't too late to find a good property, but it is something we may want to pursue a little more aggressive.

I have noticed a few buyers getting some good deals. There are even stories of investors who are buying and flipping. I hate to use the term 'flip' but the reality is that some people are getting properties below the market value and are able to make a profit in a short period of time.

I created a simple document explaining How To Buy Below Market Value. Click Here to review!

As you know, I don't waste your time with useless information so please take one minute and learn how we can find value in this market. It is harder to find good value when the market is active, so this is the time that you need an aggressive agent who knows how to create value.

Please give me a call.
