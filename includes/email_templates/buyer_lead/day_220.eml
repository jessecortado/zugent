Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Most of my buyer clients are concerned with property taxes in our area. The fact is, there are areas where property taxes seem to be fair and other areas where they are much lower.

I think it is important that you know these different tax rates in our market. This could influence your purchase decisions.
