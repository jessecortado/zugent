Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I was advising another client recently and thought I would share some of the information we discussed. We both know that buying real estate is a serious matter, and buying the right property at the right price makes a big difference in the long-term outlook of your investment.

The following are reasons Smart Money is following real estate right now:

1) Interest rates are still low - 2% less in mortgage interest could amount to thousands of dollars in savings over the life of the loan.

2) Active listing supply - There are still some good properties listed on the market for sale. The quality properties tend to sell quickly, so you have to act as soon as they hit the market.

3) Market Timing - You can never time the market perfectly, but if you could, it would look like this...Low interest rates, quality properties to choose, and motivated sellers.

Competition for the best properties is increasing, so I created a short report explaining 'How To Buy Below Market Value.'

Let me know about any properties you see that you would like additional information for. I can find out what the current owner paid, property taxes, and almost anything else you would want to know.
