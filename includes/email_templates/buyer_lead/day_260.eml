Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I have noticed there is a lot of bad information on the internet about what a buyer is responsible for paying at closing. Every market is different, and it is critical that you know what you have to pay for before you agree to a contract on a particular property.

The good news is that we can create a strategy to see if we can get the seller to pay some of your closing costs. This could save you a few thousand dollars.

As always, I am committed to making sure you are the most informed consumer in our real estate market.

Let me know what else I can do to help you.
