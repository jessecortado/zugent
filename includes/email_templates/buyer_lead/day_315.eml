Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

A few more quality properties were recently sold in our market. As you know, I monitor the weekly sales sheets, and I have noticed that there have been some great properties sold for a bit less than I expected.

I am not a pushy salesperson, so I will only share properties with you if you are still thinking of buying sometime in the near future.

I am updating my 'Serious Buyer' list. This is the list that I keep close to my side so I can call them immediately when a good deal hits the MLS.

Should I place you on this list?

By the way, I created a quick explanation that describes the "3 Characteristics of a Savvy Investor."

Let me know what I can do for you.
