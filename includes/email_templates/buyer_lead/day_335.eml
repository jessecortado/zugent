Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

We have been sending you information on new listings and price updates for a while now. With all of this information, I bet you have a good understanding of our market. With that being said, I am curious as to when you would like to purchase a property? There’s no rush, but new listings come onto the market every day and I need to know if you are wanting me to put you on my 'short' list. That is the list of buyers that I know are ready to make a move once they find a good property.

Just reply to this email stating that you want this information and I will make sure I single you out when a great buy comes my way.

I look forward to helping you soon.
