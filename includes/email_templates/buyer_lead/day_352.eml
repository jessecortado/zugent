Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I sent you an email a few weeks ago regarding activity in the market. I am not sure if you had a chance to review this information, "3 Strategies to Beat the Competition and Win the Best Properties!".

I suggest you review this because the real estate market is changing and I want to make sure that you stay on top of things. It may be time to take the leap and start looking at some properties. There are a lot of good investments out there right now, but things may change soon, making it tougher to find a property at these prices.

What is a good time and number I can call to discuss the market and a few properties that may fit your needs?
