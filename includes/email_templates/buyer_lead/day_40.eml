Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I wanted to share some information about the current real estate market that can make a big difference in your future purchase. I am sure you are paying attention to the discussions about interest rates.

Most buyers do not understand how to calculate the actual cost of a high interest rate environment. I cannot predict when interest rates will rise again, but we do know how a higher interest rate will affect your monthly payments and the impact on building wealth through real estate.
