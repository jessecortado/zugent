Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I just wanted to check in with you to make sure we are meeting your expectations and you are receiving the listings that fit your needs. Our search tools usually work very well, but sometimes it's good to know there is a real person available to assist you at any time!

In the meantime, I created a quick report explaining how to find Quality Properties at a Discount. A lot of purchasers find this to help them better understand the process.

Let me know if you would like me to hand-select a few quality properties for your review.

Your Realtor,
