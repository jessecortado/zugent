Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I know you are getting my listing updates, but I wanted to make sure that you have been informed about the common fees that are associated with the purchase of real estate in our local market. I created a document which maps out the fees (closing costs) that you will incur.

Here is the Good News! I do have a negotiation strategy that can get the seller to pay them for you.

Please review this closing cost worksheet so you are not surprised once we find a property.
