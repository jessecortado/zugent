Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I had a buyer who recently overpaid for property insurance. There is a big difference in insurance companies and the rates they charge.

I know you were thinking of buying a new property at one time. Have you already purchased?

You may want to talk to an insurance agent to see how much property insurance will cost on the property you are thinking of buying. This could save you a few thousands dollars each year.

As your preferred real estate agent, I am always looking to help you save money and find quality properties.

Here is an insurance resource you may want to consider.
