Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

We just negotiated a great deal for one of my buyers. I wanted to check in to see if you have purchased anything yet?

You were looking at properties on my website in the past and wanted to see how I could help you.

If you are qualified to purchase, there is no time better than now to do so.

I made a list of reasons Why People Are Buying Real Estate. You may want to check it out.

I am not a high-pressure sales person, but I do know that there are some wealth-building opportunities in our market today.

Give me a call.
