Do I need to adjust your search criteria?

You should be receiving new listing alerts from my website. I don’t think you have purchased yet and am wondering if you have changed your mind?

Realistically, when do you think you will be buying your next piece of real estate?

I have created a Real Estate Purchase Checklist for your review.

Click if applies: Buying in next 6 months Checklist

Click if applies: Selling in the next 90 days Checklist

Click if applies: Selling in the next 6 months Checklist

It is important to be ready when the right property comes around. Please let me know when you will be ready to make a purchase.

If you need to sell prior to buying, let me know and I will check my list of buyers to see if I have one that may be interested in your property.
