Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Did you ever purchase a property?

I was sending you new listing alerts in the past and never heard if you purchased something. Recently, I have been getting the inside scoop on some listings prior to them going on the MLS. If you are still considering a purchase, please let me know and I will make sure that you are notified when I hear of something really good.

What are you looking for now?

Area?

Bedrooms?

Size?

Price?

I look forward to working with you in the future.
