Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I am hearing about some great properties that will be listed on the market over the next few weeks.

I do have a short list of buyers that I like to send the ‘best buys’ to via email. As you can imagine, when a quality property hits the market, it gets a lot of showings and typically an offer within the first week. If it is a good deal, then it is sold within 2 weeks for sure.

So I know your time-frame, which will help me understand which deals to share, please let me know the following…

When would you like to purchase your future property?

Please click the one that applies to you most:

30 days or less (I want to look at properties this week)

30-60 days (I want to look at properties in the next few weeks)

60-90 days (Please send me new listing alerts – Will start looking soon)

6 or more months (I am learning about the market – Need to get things in order before I start)

I appreciate you letting me know your goals. This will allow me to identify the properties that best fit your needs. For example, if you are buying within the next 30 days, I will be sending you the hottest deals immediately because we know they won’t be around in 6 months.

Also, please update me any time your plans change.

You can contact me by email, phone or text.
