Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I just wanted to check with you to make sure you are finding our listing updates helpful? I don’t want to bombard you with useless information, so please let me know if I should make some adjustments to your search criteria.

You should be receiving updates on new listings as well as listings that have recently reduced their prices.

Please let me know if there are any "tweaks" we should make!

Thank you for using ~Company.Website~ as your real estate search tool.
