Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

As always, I want to keep you informed with the latest happenings in our local real estate market.

Maybe you are not an investor and are just looking for the perfect home, but it is good for you to know that we are seeing cases where buyers are investing in real estate and 12 months later are already experiencing appreciation. Meaning, they have started building equity in the property in just a short time period.

This is a great time to be looking at real estate.

Tell me about your goals:

When would you like to purchase your future property?

Please click the one that applies to you most:

30 days or less (I want to look at properties this week)

30-60 days (I want to look at properties in the next few weeks)

60-90 days (Please send me new listing alerts – Will start looking soon)

6 or more months (I am learning about the market – Need to get things on order before I start)

I am not in the business of talking you into buying, but I do want to point you in the right direction when the time is right.

Let's connect!
