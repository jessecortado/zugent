Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

You accessed real estate information from my website over a year ago. I wanted to see if you are still in the market to purchase a property?

I am fortunate to learn about some good properties before they hit the open market. Are you interested in knowing about these properties?

I don’t want to send you the information unless it is something that you would want.

Are you still in the market to purchase?

How many bedrooms do you need?

What area do you prefer?

Let me know what you are looking for and I will find it for you.

To see the new listings that just hit the market, click – New Property Search

Your Realtor,
