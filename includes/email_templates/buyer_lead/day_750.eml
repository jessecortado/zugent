Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

We are constantly adding new listings to our websites and wanted you to know that another buyer just negotiated a super deal for a piece of property. As you know, interest rates are still low and, with an aggressive strategy for negotiations, we feel we can really create value for you and your future purchase.

I created a simple explanation on how we ‘negotiated the deal down so low’. Click Here and learn the secret! I will do the same for you once we choose a property.

To be sure I am only sending you properties that fit your needs, please remind me what you are looking for:

Bedrooms?

Particular Area?

Price Range?

Let me know what you are looking for and I promise I will share the best deals with you. Click Here to Search our MLS!

Your Realtor,
