~Contact.FirstName~,

I wanted to understand a little more about what you want to accomplish. I am looking at a list of foreclosures and other properties that will be coming on the market in the upcoming weeks. A lot of these properties will be sold quick and may not be available at the time you plan to purchase. Don't worry, I will always have the inside track, so when you are ready, I will let you know of the best deals.

I am curious as to what your anticipated time-frame for a purchase will be?

I want to give you accurate information so I don't waste your time. Knowing your time-frame will help us both.
