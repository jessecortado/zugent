Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I know you are getting my listing updates, but I wanted to make sure you understand the entire process of buying real estate in our area. Too often, buyers are disappointed because an agent did not tell them what they could expect when they get to the end of the transaction. I donâ€™t want any surprises at the closing table.

The Good News! I do have a negotiation strategy that can get the seller to pay your closing costs if that will help.

I am committed to this being the best real estate purchase you ever make.

Your Realtor,
