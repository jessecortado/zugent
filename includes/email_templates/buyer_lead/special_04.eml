Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I am focusing on sending you information about properties that you are interested in based on your search criteria.

Recently, I just helped my client SELL their property for top dollar and then helped them find a good deal on a property to purchase.

Basically, they sold high and bought low.

Are you going to be selling a property before you purchase?

If so, you may want to check out this article:

Let me know if there is any information that I can share with you. If you are thinking of selling a property, let me know and I will make sure that I send you some information on today’s property values.

I know how to create demand for my listings. The more demand, the higher the sales price.
