Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

One of my buyers just got an awesome deal on a mortgage for their new real estate purchase. I was a bit surprised that they were able to buy a new property with such a good interest rate.

You may want to check in with a mortgage professional to see how the changing interest rates impacts your ability to purchase. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
