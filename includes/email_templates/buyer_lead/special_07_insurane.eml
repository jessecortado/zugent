Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I had a client who recently overpaid for property insurance because they didn’t work with the right person.

There is a big difference in insurance companies and the rates they charge.

You may want to talk to an insurance agent to see how much property insurance will cost on the property you are thinking of buying. This could save you a few thousands dollars each year.

As your preferred real estate agent, I am always looking to help you save money and find quality properties.

Here is an insurance resource you may want to consider.

This is the insurance agent that I would personally use if I were buying today.

Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you.
