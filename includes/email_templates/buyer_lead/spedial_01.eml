Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I wanted to make sure you had all of the information you need in order to purchase real estate in our local market. There are a few things that are common practice in our area that will help you negotiate a better price with the seller.

I want to make sure you are in a strong negotiating position once you find a property and make an offer.

Too many buyers leave money on the table because they are not prepared for a tough negotiation.

The following link will take you to a form with a list of documents and/or relationships that you will need.

Please click on this link and let us know which you ALREADY HAVE.

I want to be able to tell another agent that you are a STRONG buyer and, when they will accept our price, the deal will close and their seller can move on.

Let me know what you have or donâ€™t have and I will help with the coordination of the transaction.

I look forward to helping you find the perfect property.

Your Realtor,
