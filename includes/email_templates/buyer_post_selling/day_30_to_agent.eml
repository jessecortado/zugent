~Owner.FirstName~,

It is recommended that you call ~Contact.FirstName~ and see how things are going. They closed on their property around 30 days ago.

If there were any hiccups, then they have probably forgotten by now.

When you call, ask them if they will give you a review. If they are willing to give you a good review, then send them a link to where you want the review. Agents do this differently, so you may want to send them a link to your Zillow Profile, your personal website or ask them to send it via email so you can use in various locations.
