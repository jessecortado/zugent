Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Are you interested in knowing what is being listed and sold in your community?

A lot of my clients like to keep track of their property's value, and one way they do this is by looking at what is selling in the community.

Of course, I know you are not selling, but I do want to make sure I keep you informed on how the market is doing.

Let me know if you are interested in this information.

In the meantime, let me know if you need anything. I am always here to help you or anyone that is in need of a great real estate professional.

Your Realtor,
