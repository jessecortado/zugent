~Owner.FirstName~,

It is recommended that you find your client’s, ~Contact.FirstName~~Contact.LastName~, Facebook page and post a “Congratulations to ~Contact.FirstName~ on their new purchase”. Include pictures of their home on the post.

When you do it on their Facebook page, it is more likely that their family and all of their friends will see. This gives you a lot of exposure.
