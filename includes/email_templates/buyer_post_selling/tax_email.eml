Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I am sure you are busy getting everything prepared to file your taxes.

Do you need a copy of your Closing Documents for taxes purposes? There may be some items you can deduct, so let me know if you need a copy. A lot of my clients misplace this information, so it may be easier for me to send you a fresh copy than for you to have to dig through your files.

Let me know and I will send right away.

Your Realtor,
