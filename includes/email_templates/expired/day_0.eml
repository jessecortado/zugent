Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I'm glad we had a chance to speak. You are probably getting irritated by all the calls you are getting from agents who want to list your property now.

In this market, I have no doubt that you have heard all of the claims of countless agents that promise to SELL your property, only to be disappointed 6, 9, or even 12 months down the road after the property fails to sell.

This is not the time to be testing out the market or “giving the next agent a shot”. In order to sell your property for the most amount of money, YOU NEED A DIFFERENT PLAN! Many of the sellers I help have been listed multiple times in the past and failed to sell prior to me handling their property.

When a property comes off the MLS in our market, agents come out of the woodwork wanting to list it. The obvious question is "WHERE WERE ALL OF THESE AGENTS WHEN IT WAS LISTED"? It seems like everyone wants a listing but once it's listed the urgency is gone. Right?

I could not produce the results I produce if I didn't have a proven track record of selling in this market. Let me separate myself from the rest of the pack RIGHT NOW. My intention is not to simply get another listing. I understand that you don’t know me yet, but let me be clear that I intend to show you that there is a better option out there should you decide to relist the property.

I Want To Show You The Benefits Of Hiring Me.

I have studied all of the properties that have recently failed to sell and created a summary of the Reasons Why Properties Fail To Sell:
