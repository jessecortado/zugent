Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

We’ve been speaking for about two weeks now, which means we’ve lost about 14 good days on the market where your property could be getting exposure from the right marketing plan. I know that you’ve been on the market with bad results once already. That’s why I am so committed to getting to work with you and show you there is a formula for success. I’m so committed to showing you that I want to get to work today!

Once we get the property listed, I’m so certain that you will see I offer more value, communicate more often, and get better results that I will allow you a 30 day risk-free trial.

If you don’t think I have done my job after 30 days, you can fire me and I will happily withdraw the listing. With my EASY EXIT listing agreement you can feel confident you’re not going to be stuck in some long-term contract that’s not going anywhere.

I have removed the risk of choosing the wrong agent.

Can we get started?

Your Realtor,
