Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I really appreciate you allowing me an opportunity to show you the difference that hiring the right agent can make. One of the ways I have improved the level of service to my clients is asking them for a lot of feedback. I hope that the information I’ve provided you has been helpful.

I don’t often do this, but I feel based on our previous conversations that you’re like me and want to help when possible. I’m gathering more information from homeowners like yourself on what went wrong with their previous listing. Would you mind taking 2 minutes (I promise it won’t take longer than that), to answer a couple of quick questions for me, that I can share with my team, so we can work to improve the service we provide to our current and future clients?

I appreciate you considering this request; I know we’re all busy.
