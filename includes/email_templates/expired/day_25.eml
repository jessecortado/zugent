Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

You’ve probably noticed by now, most of the phone calls have stopped, HOPEFULLY!

My guess is you outlasted the majority of the agents who were simply trying to get a listing that they could collect a quick commission check for. Those agents have probably moved on to someone who came off the market in the last week or so.

I wanted to check with you to see if there’s still a possibility that you would sell?

I know I have sent you a lot of information, I hope it’s been helpful. I’m confident I can get the job done, I just need to know what needs to happen on my part to earn your business.

The fact that I’m still asking for your business is significant, because while everyone else has moved on, I’m still practicing what I preach by following up with those that I think I can help. If I didn’t believe I could help you, I would have quit also.

I’m not sure if I sent you this earlier but CHECK OUT 3 Ways Active Agents Create More Demand for Sellers.

I use the same tenacious follow-up with the buyers that I show my listings clients.

What’s keeping me from going to work for you?
