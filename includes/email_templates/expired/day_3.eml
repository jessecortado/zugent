Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

As you can see, I want to earn your business. I am sure that you are considering your options about selling and what agent you will choose if you decide to attempt selling again.

Most owners do not know that there are significant differences from one agent to another. The main difference is the way they approach marketing your property for sale. You may feel that your last agent listed your property in the MLS and then forgot about it. Unfortunately, that is common in the industry.

I would like to discuss a marketing strategy with you, one that details the actions I will take to get your property sold. I am confident that you will be relieved knowing that I actually have a plan for selling real estate...I am not just “winging” it.

Thank you for the consideration,
