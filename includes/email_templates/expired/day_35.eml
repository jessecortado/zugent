Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

Did you sell your property or is it still available?

I hope all is well. I wanted to check in with you and see if you were able to get your property sold. I don’t recall seeing it back on the market and wondered if you found a buyer on your own?

If you would allow me to, I thought it might make sense to consider pushing the property out to my database of Buyer Sources, if you would still consider selling?

I think I may have told you about the 3 most critical areas to attract buyers from. If not, you may want to view it now. Take a Quick Look Here.

Please keep that information between us. My competition likes to know exactly what I do. I doubt they would commit to spending the time and money I do on marketing but I’d rather not reveal all of my sellers' advantages.

I’ll try to reach out to you again soon, so we can catch up and discuss whether the property is still available. Maybe there’s a win-win somewhere for us if selling is still in your future?

Thanks,

Your Real Estate Resource.
