Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I just wanted to check in with you and let you know that I was speaking to some other agents about your property. We have a pretty aggressive company, so I figured I would show them the old listing details and see if they felt there was anything wrong with the property that may have kept it from selling.

We all agreed that it’s a great property and there are buyers out there for it but it just needs to be marketed a little more aggressively.

The rules have changed, Marketing has changed, Sellers expectations have changed but……..MOST AGENTS HAVE NOT CHANGED!

It’s important that you know that I actually market my client’s property to a different audience than most agents.

Click below to see the 3 groups of buyers that write the majority of offers for my clients' properties. I share this with you because I am committed to showing you that there’s substance to what I do differently, instead of a bunch of “fluff”. In exchange for my transparency with you I ask that you keep this strategy between you and I. Most of my competition would love to know what I do to get the results I get. Please keep this one between us.
