Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

There are several things I think would be very effective in creating REAL DEMAND for your property if you were to allow me to start marketing it right now..

1. It needs to be sent immediately to our past clients who have already purchased similar properties. They know others buyers who may be interested.

2. It needs to be put in front of all of the buyers who have requested to be shown similar properties to yours but haven’t purchased. There are currently over 100 of these buyers in the market looking.

3. It needs to go onto our syndicated marketing program, which covers over 600 websites and is micro-marketed to our highest frequency website visitors, those who come primarily from the markets that feed our market.

I could start the process today. If you’re still considering relisting the property simply review my Easy Exit Listing Agreement and I’ll give you a call to clarify any other questions you have. After we clear up any details, we can get to work. Won’t that be great?

You are in complete control with the Easy Exit Listing Agreement
