Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Fire Me Any Time!

Each week I prioritize my goals for the week. It’s important to me to get to work on your property right away. As an aggressive agent, there is a process that I go through with my listings to create maximum exposure.

I know that the sooner I get to work on that process the quicker I can generate an offer. I know that you didn’t get good results the last time you chose a “professional” agent.

I’m determined to show you that I’m different. I want to explain what I do to take away the concern that you may get locked into a long contract with someone who doesn’t get results.

I look forward to working together,
