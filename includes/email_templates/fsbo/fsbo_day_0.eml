Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

We spoke on the phone earlier and I wanted to make sure that you had my direct email address. I know that you are not in need of anything at this moment, but I want to make sure we connect in the event we can help each other in the future. I wish you the best in selling your property.

Let me know if I can help you in the future.
