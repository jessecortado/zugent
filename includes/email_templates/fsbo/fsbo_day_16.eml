Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Here is a Marketing Checklist for selling a property by owner.

Hopefully you are getting some showings on your property. Our listings are getting a lot of showings, and we just put another one of them under contract with a pre-approved buyer.

There are dozens of marketing strategies that are used to market properties for sale, and I thought I would share a list of what other FSBO’s are doing in our market. There are a lot of FSBO owners right now, and the successful ones are using multiple marketing techniques to find qualified buyers.

I am not the agent that will tell you that you will not sell your property on your own. I actually hope you are successful, and if you ever find yourself in need of a hard working agent, I hope you will interview me for that job.

Let me know if I can help you in any way.

Your Realtor,
