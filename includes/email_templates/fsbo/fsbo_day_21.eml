Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

Hopefully your answer is NO, but is your property still available?

I have been showing a lot of properties lately, and I am wondering if yours is still for sale or if you have it under contract by now?

If it is still available, would you be open to some ideas on how I could help you get this sold?

Feel free to look at my FSBO Commission Compromise program. When you click on the link it will describe my 'flexible commission structure'. I know a lot of owners have a hard time paying commissions, so I created a plan that seems to be fair for everyone. A lot of owners appreciate my willingness to compromise.

Take a look at this and let's talk.
