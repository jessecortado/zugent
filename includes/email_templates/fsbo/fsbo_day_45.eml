Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope things are going well with you and your property. I wanted you to know that the market has been very active lately, and I feel your property would be very desirable if exposed to more qualified buyers.

We just sold another home in less than 30 days. The seller attempted to FSBO for about 60 days and decided to allow us to market the home for them.

I would really like to discuss a marketing strategy for your property when you are open to it. We may find that we can both help each other accomplish our goals.

In case the link did not work last time, Click on FSBO Commission Compromise and learn more about my flexible commission program. As I mentioned, I am aware that commissions are a factor, so I have created a commission structure which is fair to all.

I look forward to helping you soon.
