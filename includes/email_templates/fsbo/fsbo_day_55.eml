I am not sure if I sent you a copy of the REQUIRED State Real Estate Disclosure Documents. These documents are required to be signed by the buyer and the seller prior to ratifying a contract. As a matter of fact, if these documents are not signed, it could deem a sales contract null and void.

This doesn’t only apply to real estate agent’s; this applies to owners like yourself who are selling on their own.

I have heard of times when FSBO’s lost a sale because of a failure to disclose properly. Even worse, there are people ‘acting’ as buyers in hopes they can find a way to catch someone failing to disclose something, and then they later on take them to court and try to win some money. I know, it’s a shame, but these are the risks we deal with in real estate today.

I am sure you want to do everything right so I hope you find these documents helpful.

Let me know if you need an explanation.
