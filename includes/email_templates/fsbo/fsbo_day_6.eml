Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I was talking to another FSBO yesterday who had sold recently and they gave me an idea that I thought I would pass along. It actually helped them sell the property.

They posted their property on www.craigslist.com two times per day for 15 straight days. Through the process, they received about 10 calls and numerous emails. I donâ€™t know if you are doing this, but I have been doing this for my clients and I can confirm that there are some good buyers on that website. You have to sift through a bunch of people, but if you have the time it may be worth it. Best of all, it is free.

I hope this helps.

Let me know if I can be of service to you.
