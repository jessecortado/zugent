Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

I don’t believe I ever mentioned that I have an Easy Exit Listing Program for FSBO’s.

Feel free to Click Here for complete details.

This is a No-Strings-Attached program that allows you to fire me at any time for anything. I believe you are still attempting to secure a buyer for your property on your own. I am sure you have heard stories of agents that listed properties and never did anything. I am not that type of agent and I back that promise up by offering you a No-Questions-Asked Easy Exit Option.

Not only do I want to earn your business and show you that I am a hard working agent, I am also compromising with FSBO’s in two ways:

I could only offer these two great programs if I was confident that I could help you with your property. I am NOT going to take your listing and disappear. I will work hard to market your property aggressively and secure a qualified buyer at your agreed-upon price.

Let me know if you are open to discussing this further.

Your Realtor,
