Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

It was great to speak with you. One of my goals as a professional Real Estate Agent is to become your resource for all things Real Estate.

While you may not have any immediate plans to buy or sell, please let me know if there is anything I can help you with in the future. There are a lot of property owners in your area that I keep updated with the local market conditions. In order to make the best decisions on your investments, it's critical that you have the best, most accurate information on how the market is affecting your investments.

I will stay in touch with you from time to time to let you know of any updates on how things are going. If you need anything in between, don't hesitate to call or email me any time. Thanks and have a great week.
