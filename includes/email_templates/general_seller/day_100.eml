Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Our local real estate market is still very active.

As you know, I have continued to stay in touch with you. I believe in delivering value to my clients, and good communication is one thing that I know property owners appreciate.

Property owners are catching onto our active market, and I have had multiple requests for updated market research on property they may one day sell.

Would you like to know what your property would sell for right now?

I just hope that you will consider me one day if you ever decide to do something.

Please let me know what else I can provide for you. I am committed to being your preferred resource for all things REAL ESTATE.

BTW...If you know someone looking to invest in today's market, please let them know that we have the Newest Listings to hit the MLS on ~Company.Website~.

Your Real Estate Resource,
