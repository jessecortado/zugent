Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I forgot to mention to you in the last email to go ahead and bookmark or save my personal website to your desktop.

My site will give you the most up-to-date information in regards to the market conditions.

My personal website, which is ~Company.Website~, can be your first stop whenever you have a question regarding Real Estate, investing, buying, selling, etc. You can use this to search our local MLS, and of course there are some outstanding resource materials on my site to help you learn about the process of buying and selling in this market.

Many of my past clients and others in my database have also told me that they print each update that comes out. If you're like me, you read something and you don't have an immediate need for the information it contains, but if you don't file it away somewhere you have to search and search to find it again when it's important.

Go ahead and print whatever you need from my website and updates and please know that you are welcome to call me any time if you have a question that you can't find the answer to.

I can't fit everything that I know or have experience with on a website, but with a quick email or phone call I can get you the answers you need. Thanks again for allowing me to be your Real Estate Resource.
