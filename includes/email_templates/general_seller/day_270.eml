You may not be in this position, but I wanted to let you know that, right now, the banks are still working with sellers who are under water on their mortgage.

In many cases, the owners are able to get out from under a mortgage that is significantly higher than what the property can sell for in today’s market.

You may have heard of the process, which is called a short-sale. It can be a daunting task to determine the in’s and out’s of how they work. If you know anyone that may be in this situation, please have them read this information...

I am not sure when the last time we looked at the value of your real estate but please let me know if you are interested in an update.
