I continue to see positive trends in our market and I know you have too. When there are positive changes in the market, it can sometimes lead to better prices than in the past. I have noticed a few shifts in the market worth noting...

1) Some properties have seen appreciation.

2) Some properties are getting mulitple offers

3) Some properties are selling over full-list price.

If you want to dial down and get more focused on a specific pricing strategies for your property, call or email me today.

Just so you know, there are no obligations and I understand you may just simply be curious with no intentions to sell any time soon. That’s quite all right. My job is to keep you informed. It looks like we’ll continue to see some positive trends for a little while at least.
