Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I noticed some nice properties are failing to sell right now.

Have you ever wondered about those properties that you see that look like they are quality and seem to be priced correctly for the market, but are SITTING instead of SELLING?

I see them all the time, and I can only imagine the frustration of being on the market for months and months without a single offer. It’s not a fluke, and it’s usually not the owner's fault, much less the home’s fault. I have compiled a breakdown of the most common reasons why homes fail to sell, even when they are priced right.

Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you.

Have a great day!
