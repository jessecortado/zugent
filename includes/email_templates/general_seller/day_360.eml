As you know, I am always keeping you up to speed on changes in our market. It appears the market is remaining active based on the number of closings that are taking place each month. There are a few suggestions that I pass on to my clients about this time each year. I hope you find them helpful..

Make sure you review your property's value 4 times per year. You must do a quarterly review.
Make sure you check with your agent (ME) before you make any major improvements or additions on your home. You need to see how it will impact your value.
If you decide to put your property on the market...Make sure you work with an agent that has a lot of exposure on the internet. Marketing is critical!

Remember, you do not have to do business with me for me to provide you with real estate information. Let me know how I can help you.

Your Realtor,
