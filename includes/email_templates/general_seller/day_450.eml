Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

I hope all is well. I wanted to check in with you and see if you were giving any thought to selling or if you knew someone who may be considering putting their property on the market?

I think I may have told you about the 3 most critical areas to attract buyers. If not, you can take a quick look here: Please keep that information between us. My competition likes to know exactly what I do. I doubt they would commit to spending the time I do on marketing, but I’d rather not reveal all of my sellers' advantages.

I’ll try to reach out to you again soon, so we can catch up and discuss whether there are any short-term plans for you to sell. Maybe there’s a win-win somewhere for us if selling is in your future?

Your Realtor,
