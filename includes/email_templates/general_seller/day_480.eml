Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

In my experience, when properties fail to sell with an agent the seller usually feels like they missed some important pieces of information during the interview process.

Because most sellers feel like agents are pretty much the same, they often make hiring decisions based off of gut feel or, worse yet, solely off what the agent says they will do. YIKES!

Over the years, I started compiling a list of questions that I tell my friends and family who are out of state to ask the agents they are interviewing. I thought it would be helpful for you to review this list.

I encourage you to use these questions when speaking with agents who are interested in listing your home. Don’t be surprised if you get some blank stares from other agents. It’s likely that they haven’t been asked, or even thought about these questions in the past.

I hope this has some value to you.

Thanks,
