Dear ~Contact.FirstName~,

We’ve been in contact for a while now, and you probably realize that I’m different from most agents that you have spoken to in the past. I have shared several strategies that I use to get maximum exposure for my clients when they hire me to sell a property.

I’m so committed to providing results and a great selling experience that if (and when) you get ready to make a move in our market, I will offer you an unconditional, 30-day Trial Listing Period should you decide to list your property.

Once we get the property listed, I’m so certain that you will see that I offer the best value, communication, and results that I am willing to give you a 30-day risk free trial.

If you don’t think I have done my job after 30 days, you can fire me and I will happily withdraw the listing. With my EASY EXIT listing agreement you can feel confident you’re not going to be stuck in some long-term contract that’s not going anywhere.

I look forward to helping you.

Your Realtor,
