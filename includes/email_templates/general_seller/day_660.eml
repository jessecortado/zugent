~Contact.FirstName~,

I think I sent you an email a few months ago asking if you knew anyone looking to buy or sell real estate. I am committed to making this year the best year of my career, and I could use a little help. I am sure you know other realtors, but I wanted to see if you could recommend me the next time you hear someone talking about real estate?

I will make sure that I take care of anyone you send my way. My goal is to add value to my clientâ€™s real estate transaction, so you can be confident that I will guide your friends, family or co-workers in the right direction.

Some of the most popular transactions right now...

Condo Buying

Condo Selling

Home Buying

Home Selling

Buying or selling land

Rental Investments

Let me know if you know anyone looking to do any of the above.

Thank you for your consideration,

Your Realtor,
