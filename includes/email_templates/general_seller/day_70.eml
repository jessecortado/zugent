Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

It is amazing how many people start giving you their advice when you tell them you are thinking of selling your property. In most cases, this advice is coming from people that do not sell real estate on a full-time basis.

When a seller decides that they are going to put their property on the market for sale, sometimes itâ€™s a friend, sometimes it's a relative, and sometimes it's a complete stranger who happens to be an agent. Avoid the costly and time-consuming process of listing a property and NOT getting results.

There are 3 mistakes that I see sellers make all of the time. I want you to be successful THE FIRST TIME.

I created a document for you to learn what to do and what not to do:
