Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Real Estate Sales are really good right now.

Lately, I have noticed a spike in activity in our market. I always like to keep the consumer informed when the market is moving. In the event you are thinking of selling or buying this year, we may need to have a conversation and check on the market conditions.

As you know, I never use pressure tactics to attempt to get someone to sell. But, I do want you to know that I am here if you need a top agent.

Have you ever seen my Estimated Sellers Net Proceeds Calculator?

I created this to help potential clients understand an approximate net they would receive if they were to sell.

Let me know if you or anyone you know would like to further the conversation about selling.
