I hope all is well with you and your family. I wanted to reach out to you and share a quick story from a seller appointment that I had the other day. These are the types of things that I feel COMPELLED to share with my inner circle about our industry.

The Conversation: The seller called me and was so excited to tell me EVERYTHING that she had done to prepare her home to be placed on the market. She literally spent tens of thousands of dollars over the last 90 days on aesthetic improvements to the home.

The home was a SHOWPLACE. She told me she had taken all of the ideas from her time watching home re-modeling, and flipping shows on HGTV. She was now prepared to put it on the market in hopes to recoup all of her money and more!

Unfortunately, she over-improved her home to the point where she may not be able to recoup even the initial investment she made on the upgrades.

This month, if you hear any of your friends or family who are considering putting a property up for sale, PLEASE share this story with them.

BEFORE making any major improvements, review the specifics of the current inventory and most recent sales. A true professional in our industry will let you know what improvements will get you the best return and which ones will have little benefit.

I hope this saves you or someone you know some time and/or money in the future. As always, let me know if I can be of service to you now or in the future.

Your Realtor,
