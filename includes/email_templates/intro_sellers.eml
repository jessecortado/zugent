Hello ~Contact.FirstName~,

Not all marketing plans are created equal. An agentâ€™s primary responsibility is to help create massive exposure for your property. MASSIVE Exposure creates More Demand. More Demand Creates Significantly More Showings. Significantly More showings give you a higher probability of finding the PERFECT BUYER vs. just finding someone who will put an offer in (LOW-BALL BUYER).

The PERFECT BUYER for your property is going to pay MORE, and make an offer SOONER, than the rest.

Makes sense, right?

As an ACTIVE AGENT, I am committed to 3 VERY IMPORTANT activities to create the most exposure for your property.

Thanks for allowing me to be your Real Estate Resource.
