Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I was thinking about you the other day and thought I would mention that I spend time with various business people who are masterminding different business opportunities and business challenges. As you know, my focus is on real estate, but I find it helpful to network with people in other businesses as well. Different perspectives are always beneficial.

If you feel there is ever a time where we could get together and brainstorm about opportunities, then please give me a call or text.

Maybe we can come up with a way to help each other grow in business.

PS. If you have a linkedin account, Facebook, or any other rating systems, if you request that I “endorse” you, I would be glad to a take a minute to do so.
