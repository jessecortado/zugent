~Contact.FirstName~,

Something just occurred to me and, before I forgot, I wanted to send you a quick email. A few months ago, I sent you an email regarding your property tax value and I have an idea on how to make sure you are not paying more than you should...

When your next tax bill comes out, call me. I want to see if there is any way that I may be able to help you get your assessed value lowered. I have done it in the past for clients and saved some of them quite a bit of money. There is nothing to do right now, but make sure you remember to call me when you get your next tax bill.

P.S. Print this email and put it in your 4th Quarter File, which is usually when most tax bills arrive in the mailbox.

Have a great day!
