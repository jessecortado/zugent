The market has been VERY ACTIVE.

I think you know the past year has been good for selling real estate. As matter of fact, the last 12 months may be the most active I have seen in the last few years. I have been evaluating a lot of property values for various clients and have noticed that prices have been moving in the right direction.

Right now, we have clients looking for particular properties, but there are very few available for them to choose from at this moment. I am wondering if you or anyone you know are thinking of selling in the near future?

I am not saying that I have a buyer today for your property, but I do want to know if I should put you on my "Seller Alert" list?

This is the list of people who I know would consider selling if they had the opportunity.

Let me know and I will put you on that list.

Have a great week!
