Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I don't know if I ever mentioned that I have many connections to various vendors who offer services on about anything that has to do with a piece of property. I want you to feel free to call me before you hire someone you don't know.

I can usually give you a recommendation on prices and a company's reputation.

Many times, these same companies give my friends and clients a discount.

This is just one more way that I support those that support me.

By the way....If I should be recommending you to my clients, please share with me what type of clients you are looking for. I will put you on my preferred vendor list.
