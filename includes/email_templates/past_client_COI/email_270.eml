Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Have you put any thought to investing in real estate right now?

Personally, I have been looking for quality positions to place some money and I run across some good real estate opportunities from time to time. I am not the type of real estate agent that pushes property on people so I can make a commission. I do have a good group of real estate investors that I keep in touch with in case I come across a good deal. Have you thought of investing in Real Estate in the past?

I understand how to evaluate investments and would be more then happy to run numbers on anything you come across.

Here’s a document I created for my clients. 7 Mistakes to Avoid When Buying In Today’s Market.

Because there is so much opportunity right now in owning properties as investments, people who never owned investment properties are jumping in.

I want to make sure that they know the basics so they can avoid the “Rookie mistakes” that can happen.

Next time someone you know is talking about investing in RE, make sure they know the basics so they avoid some of the common issues.
