I wanted to get your opinion on what the general consumer thinks about our local market. We are hearing so many things on the news about real estate, and I am wondering what people like you think about the following.....

Do you think our market is a buyers market or a sellers market?

Do you think prices are going up or down?

How long do you think it takes to sell a property in this market?

What do you think a realtor's most important job is?

I appreciate you taking the time to email your answers. This will help me create a better business strategy for the future. Let me know if I can ever do something for you.

Your Realtor,
