Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Did you keep anyone from making any home improvement mistakes last month?

After I sent that email to you, I started thinking of all of the other “MYTHS” that I have dispelled with my family and friends during family reunions and holiday gatherings.

I wanted to share them with you so you’re “in the know”. I’m sure people look to you for advice a lot, and, if the subject of Real Estate comes up, you’ll have the inside track on a few subjects.

MYTH #1: Now is a good time to sell or now is a bad time to sell:

The truth is, there is no inherently good or bad time to sell your property, just like there is no inherently good or bad time to buy a property. Whether it makes sense for someone to buy or sell depends on the individual. Think of the the Real Estate market just about EVERYWHERE in 2005. How many people were told it was a great time to buy an investment? Look how that turned out.

If you ask an agent if it’s a good time to buy or sell, and they give you an answer without digging in to find out what your specific situation is and what your goal is for the property, rest assured, they are probably putting a commission check ahead of your best interest.

I hope this allows you to keep a friend or family member from making a mistake in my industry at some point. If I can help you or someone you know don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
