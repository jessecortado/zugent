Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

Just wanted to send you a quick note to check in with you and say hello. I hope all is well. I was just thinking about a movie that gave so much insight into the unprecedented Real Estate crash that started in 2008. If you haven’t seen the movie THE BIG SHORT, it’s worth checking out.

I shared this with someone else recently because they made the comment that they had several properties that they were holding until “the market came back”. After a few more questions, I was clear that they were waiting for the next 2005 to happen. I simply requested that they check out the movie and then let me know their thoughts.

After seeing the show, they have begun to re-evaluate their plans.

Have a great week!
