Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

You may not be selling right now, but it is neat to see how much you would actually net in your pocket if you did sell in today's market.

I created a calculator for my clients to calculate how different price points impact their bottom line.

You can enter different list prices and auto-calculate what the net would be. A lot of my sellers use this to make informed decisions.
