~Contact.FirstName~,

I know we spoke about this in the past, but I wanted to make sure I reminded you. If you ever want to get some information on a property that you know is on the market, or if you’re wondering what something may be worth that isn’t for sale yet, contact me.

I can do a simple property valuation very quickly for anything in our area. I also have a large network of agents across the country if a friend or family member of yours needs some help outside of our area.

Feel free to drop me a quick email if you would like me to set up an ongoing saved search for you to get sold data on properties in and around your area. It’s a great way to stay informed on market values.
