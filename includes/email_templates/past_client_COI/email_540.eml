I know I have mentioned this in the past, but I wanted to bring it up again. There is often a discrepancy between property tax values and the actual market value. In some cases it’s in the owner’s favor, but most of the time it’s the other way around.

If you come across your tax bill, go ahead and send me a copy. I can give you an idea of whether it’s in line or whether there is a chance you may be able to appeal and save some money.

If you decide to appeal, I can provide the documentation of property values that may help you get the assessed value adjusted.
