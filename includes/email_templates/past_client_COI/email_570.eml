~Contact.FirstName~,

I know we’ve both been busy, but I want you to know I appreciate you allowing me to be your Real Estate Resource. You may not realize this, but I look to you as a resource and appreciate your feedback on the information I send to you.

What can I help YOU with right now?

Can I provide feedback for anything you are working on?

Are you or a family member working on anything that I might be able to support?

If there’s nothing right now, no problem, just know that I am here to help you down the road.

As you know, I want to earn the right to help you with your real estate needs. Let me know how I can be your go-to agent.
