Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

One of the great things about being in this business every day is that, as an agent, I see everyones' homes when they go on the market.

Better yet, I see what price they eventually sell for. I want to make sure that you have information at your fingertips for the market.

Consider me your CNBC of real estate. Any time you need to know what a particular piece of real estate (stock) is worth, just shoot me an email, a text, or a call.

You want to see what is listed in our area?

Thanks again for allowing me to be your Real Estate Resource!
