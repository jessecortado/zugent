~Contact.FirstName~,

I know, thatâ€™s a pretty strange question, but most of the time, at least for me, the answer has been YES IT IS!!!.

I am constantly upgrading my list of service providers. I am proud of the list that I have, and I eagerly provide referrals to these providers because I know my clients will be taken care of.

Before you make moves in terms of repairs, inspections, appraisals, surveys, etc., reach out to me. I am willing to open my ROLODEX and provide you with any of my professional service providers so you can have a great experience.

BTW, is there something I should be referring people to you for?

Thanks and have an incredible day!
