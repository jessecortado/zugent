~Contact.FirstName~,

I sent you an email last month about service providers. One thing I forgot to mention was that I am always looking for additional people to add to my list too. I keep most of my providers very busy and there are times when, as hard as they try, they can’t get a job done in the time that someone needs to complete the project.

If you have a similar list, send it over to me, and if you’d be kind enough to make the initial introduction I would be happy to reach out to your preferred people and send some business their way. That way, I always have a top notch provider to choose from, and you do as well.
