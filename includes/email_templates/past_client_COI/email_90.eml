Hi ~Contact.FirstName~,

I had some clients recently tell me what they were paying in property taxes, and I realized there could be a mistake.

I wanted to check with you to see if you ever check on the assessed value of your property and how it compares to the real value?

For those that are NOT selling, it is always important to know if your property tax is being calculated correctly. If you have never appealed you property tax value, then give me a call sometime so we can look into this. You could be okay, but I have helped a few people save thousands in taxes by pointing them in the right direction.

Let me know if you need anything.

Take Care,
